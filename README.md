# Cloudflare_Terraformer

# Premise
This is a small project I started because my company managed so many DNS records in Cloudflare, yet none of them were in Terraform code. I wanted a program that would be able to generate both Terraform code for the DNS records, and the associated Terraform import commands so that a working Terraform state could be generated.

# How to run

## Python Standalone


## Docker
Docker is still a work in progress...
